I usually write for the Infinum blog, lately mostly about [digital transformation in the FinTech industry](https://infinum.com/blog/author/zeljko-plesac/).

You can also find some of the talks I have given at [conferences](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=zeljko+plesac) and [podcasts](https://www.agiledrop.com/podcast/zeljko-plesac-solving-collaboration-challenges-digital-product-development).

Partnerships Director @ [Infinum](http://infinum.com).

Having joined the company 12 years ago as an Android developer, I was the Lead mobile developer on several different products for the Financial sector: mobile banking, loyalty, self-care, insurance, and neo-banking applications.

Over the years, I've shifted to more business roles, working closely with the Business Development department as Technical Director and Infinum Alliance Director. In the last couple of years, my main focus has been growing partnership relations with different technical providers, managing clients working in the Finance and IoT industries, and growing our Partner network [Infinum Alliance](https://alliance.infinum.com).

I'm a regular speaker at conferences and meetups, and I write for the Infinum blog on various topics concerning digital transformation in the FinTech industry.

In my free time, I like good books, good hikes, and good diving spots.

Still trying to code, lastly mostly in Ktor, Django and AppScript in Google Sheets.

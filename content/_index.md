Partnerships Director @ [Infinum](http://infinum.com).

Having joined the company 12 years ago as an Android developer, I was the Lead mobile developer on several different products for the Financial sector: mobile banking, loyalty, self-care, insurance, and neo-banking applications.

Over the years, I transitioned into business-oriented roles, working closely with the Business Development department as Technical Director and Infinum Alliance Director. Today, as Partnerships Director, I focus on expanding strategic relationships with tech providers, managing key accounts in Finance and IoT, and growing our [Infinum Alliance](https://alliance.infinum.com) network.

I'm a regular speaker at conferences and meetups, and I write for the Infinum blog on various topics concerning digital transformation in the FinTech industry.

In my free time, I like good books, good hikes, and good diving spots.

I still find time to code, lastly mostly in Ktor, Django and AppScript in Google Sheets.
